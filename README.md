Data format
Please refer to 'test' directory
the test data is generated by microarray.

#     steps    #
Rscript combined_methods.R expfile phefile datatype=[ma/rseq] datadir
python predict.py datadir outdir

python run_cgps.py -e expfile -p phefile -d datatype -s species -o outdir

* expfile: file to save expression data
* phefile: file to save the experiment category of expfile
* data type : for expression data, "rseq" for RNA-Seq data, 'ma' for microarray data
* datadir: directory to save the results of individual methods
* species: abbr of the species, to find the abbr of the species for analysis, please refer to http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/catalog/org_list.html
* outdir : directory to save the combined results of CGPS
